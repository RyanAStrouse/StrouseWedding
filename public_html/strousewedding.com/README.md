Wedding
=======

I am creating a website in order to provide information to guests of my wedding, and allow them to RSVP.

It will store names of the people invited, addresses, how many +1's, and whether or not they will be attending.



PHP/MySQL
=======

This site will use PHP for the forms and MySQL for the backend.  It will need to pull data from the db and display it for a user so they can confirm mailing address and also select whether or not they can attend.  If the information is wrong the user needs to be able to edit it and submit it to the db.

Security
=======

Even though it is a very small website only being provided to certain individuals, it will still be hosted publically... and there needs to be security measures in place so the users information cannot be leaked out.


GitHub Focus
=======

In order to track my changes, and be able to show potential employers my work/thinking process I would like to develop my website using GitHub.  It will also act as a motivator to continue to login each day and work on it.
