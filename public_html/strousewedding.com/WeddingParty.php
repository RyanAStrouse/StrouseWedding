	<h1>Wedding Party</h1>

	<p>
		Here are the people who have been with us over the course of our lives that we really could not have been without.  
		We thank them for always being there for us when we needed them most.

		<h2>Jason Gross</h2>
		<p>Apart from the bride and groom, Jason is far and away the most important member of the wedding party. Attractive, successful, charming and humble; Jason embodies what it is to be a best man. While it is understood that standing Jason in front of a crowd of people may be a distraction to the event, it was decided that the show could simply not go on without him. Jason met Ryan in high school and is currently gracing the city of Indianapolis with his alluring presence.</p>
